### About me 👋
✍🏼 I am an English<>Russian translator. More information is available at https://wordpress.intorussian.com.

👩🏻‍🏫 I have additional experience in the areas of language teaching and project management.

👩🏻‍💼 I am currently in full-time employment, and my availability for translation work is limited, but I would be happy to refer you to one of my trusted colleagues.

💻 I have pursued additional training in the field of natural language processing and am interested in machine learning applications for solving text (and speech!) based challenges.
